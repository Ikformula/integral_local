# ECS Processes Manual

This guide explains the ECS (External Client System) processes in simple terms for non-technical staff. It covers how client transactions, refunds, reporting, and staff ticketing work in the system.

---

## 1. Client Transactions
- **What is it?**
  - When a client buys tickets, their transaction is recorded in ECS.
- **How it works:**
  - Each ticket purchase increases the client's account balance.
  - The system keeps track of the number of tickets and the total value.

## 2. Refunds
- **What is it?**
  - If a ticket is cancelled, the client may get a refund.
- **How it works:**
  - The refund amount is subtracted from the client's account balance.
  - The system records the number of refunded tickets and the total refund value.

## 3. Account Balances
- **What is it?**
  - The total money a client has in their ECS account after all transactions and refunds.
- **How it works:**
  - The balance updates automatically with each transaction or refund.
  - You can view the balance as of any date in the weekly report.

## 4. Weekly Reports
- **What is it?**
  - A summary of all client and staff activities for a selected week.
- **How it works:**
  - Shows number and value of tickets sold, refunds, and balances.
  - You can filter by date range to see specific periods.
  - Reports are available in two tabs:
    - **Client Transactions & Refunds**
    - **Staff Ticket & Refund Summary**

## 5. Staff Ticketing
- **What is it?**
  - Staff can also issue tickets and process refunds.
- **How it works:**
  - Staff activities are tracked separately in the report.
  - Shows ticket and refund values for each staff member.

## 6. Filtering & Searching
- **What is it?**
  - Allows you to find specific transactions or reports.
- **How it works:**
  - Use the date filters at the top of the report page.
  - Click the tabs to switch between client and staff views.

## 7. Duplicate Prevention
- **What is it?**
  - The system checks to avoid recording the same transaction or refund twice.
- **How it works:**
  - If a duplicate is detected, it will not be added to the records.

## 8. Currency & Exchange Rates
- **What is it?**
  - Transactions may involve different currencies.
- **How it works:**
  - The system automatically converts values using the latest exchange rates.
